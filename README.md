Technical architecture document for E-SOH

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this Technical Design Document (TDD) is to provide a comprehensive and detailed description of the software system being developed, to serve as a reference for all stakeholders involved in the project. This document aims to:
* Define the software's architecture, components, and their relationships.
* Communicate the design decisions and rationale behind the chosen solutions.
* Provide clear specifications and guidelines for the development team to ensure consistent implementation of features and functionality.
* Establish a baseline for testing and validation, ensuring that the software meets the requirements and design goals.
* Serve as a reference for future maintenance, support, and enhancement of the software system.

The TDD is intended to be a living document, updated as necessary throughout the software development life cycle to reflect any changes or refinements made to the system design. It is essential for all stakeholders, including project managers, developers, testers, and end-users, to have a clear understanding of the software system's design to ensure effective collaboration and successful project completion.
